# Instagram Bot using Selenium and Beautiful Soup

This project implements an Instagram bot using the Selenium and Beautiful Soup libraries in Python. The bot is designed to perform various operations on Instagram, such as logging in to a user account, searching for profiles, following/unfollowing users, liking/unliking posts, extracting a list of followers, and checking stories of a given handle.

## Prerequisites

Before running the bot, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Selenium
- Beautiful Soup
- Chrome WebDriver (for Selenium)

You can install the required Python libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install selenium beautifulsoup4
```
You'll also need the Chrome WebDriver, which is used by Selenium to automate interactions with the Chrome browser. You can download the appropriate version of the WebDriver for your system from the [ChromeDriver Downloads page](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/).

## Getting Started
 1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/instagram-bot.git
    ```
 2. Navigate to the project directory:

 3. Place the downloaded Chrome WebDriver executable (chromedriver) in the project directory.

## Usage

   The script will guide you through different operations using the bot:

   1. **Login**: The bot will log in to your Instagram account using the provided credentials.

   2. **Search and Open Profile**: The bot will search for a given handle using the search bar and open the profile.

   3. **Follow/Unfollow**: You can choose to follow or unfollow the currently opened profile.

   4. **Like/Unlike Posts**: The bot will like or unlike a certain number of posts on the opened profile.

   5. **Extract List of Followers**: The bot will extract a list of followers from the opened profile.

   6. **Check Story**: You can check the story of the currently opened handle.    

## Note
  This bot is meant for educational purposes only and should not be used for spamming or any malicious activities.
  Instagram's terms of service might change, and using bots to automate actions on the platform could result in your 
  account being banned. 

## Acknowledgments
  This project was inspired by the need to learn about web automation and scraping using Selenium and Beautiful 
  Soup. Many thanks to the open-source community for creating and maintaining these libraries.

## Caution
```
Please remember to use this bot responsibly and considerate of Instagram's terms of service. Automating actions on social media platforms should be done ethically and with caution.   
```

I have also used this bot for some analysis for my food blogger friend so I will attach that file also.
