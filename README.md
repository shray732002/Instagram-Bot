# Instagram Bot using Selenium and Beautiful Soup

This project implements an Instagram bot using the Selenium and Beautiful Soup libraries in Python. The bot is designed to perform various operations on Instagram, such as logging in to a user account, searching for profiles, following/unfollowing users, liking/unliking posts, extracting a list of followers, and checking stories of a given handle.

## Prerequisites

Before running the bot, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Selenium
- Beautiful Soup
- Chrome WebDriver (for Selenium)

You can install the required Python libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install selenium beautifulsoup4
```
You'll also need the Chrome WebDriver, which is used by Selenium to automate interactions with the Chrome browser. You can download the appropriate version of the WebDriver for your system from the [ChromeDriver Downloads page](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/).
